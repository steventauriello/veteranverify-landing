        <p><strong>Hello, you beautiful soul who actually clicked on the Privacy Policy.</strong> You’re either very curious or very smart — maybe both. Either way, thank you for being here and taking the time to read something most people skip.</p>
        <p>Before we dive into the formal stuff, I want to tell you what’s really going on here — human to human.</p>
        <p>I’m building <strong>Veteran Verify</strong> for one reason: to create a better system for veterans, vendors, and yes, veteran-owned vendors, too. The idea was born after a large verification company told me my shop was <em>“too small”</em> to work with. That moment lit a fire. Instead of doing nothing, I decided to build something better — a platform that doesn’t play gatekeeper with data, opportunities, or trust.</p>
        <p>These corporations have locked up government data for profit. They’ve wedged themselves between veterans and the benefits they’ve earned — becoming the middlemen of patriotism. That’s not right.</p>
        <p>So, I started building my own database — from the ground up. Transparent. Secure. Respectful. Built with honesty and AI-strengthened protection.</p>
        <p>I want veterans to easily prove service, redeem discounts, and access benefits <em>without</em> having to dig up DD-214s, flash military IDs, or explain themselves every time they want a small token of appreciation for serving this country.</p>
        <p>You’re trusting me with your data, and that means everything to me. I’m not a faceless corporation. I’m a small team using the best AI tools available. We use advanced encryption and multi-layered cybersecurity — but more importantly, we lead with integrity.</p>
        <p>Locks are for honest people. No database in the world is <em>completely</em> impenetrable, and anyone who says otherwise is lying. So here’s my promise: <strong>your trust will never be taken for granted.</strong> We’ll do everything in our power to protect what you share with us — because this project only works if there’s faith between us.</p>
        <p>By submitting your information, you’re helping us build something bigger than any one company — a tool for veterans, built by those who actually care. This is about fairness, freedom, and taking back control from the few who think they own access to what belongs to all of us.</p>
        <p class="muted">Below are the formal details of our privacy policy.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- SHORT MISSION LINE (keeps your original blurb) -->
      <p>
        Veteran Verify is building a faster, simpler way for veterans to privately prove service — and for vendors to verify eligibility without friction. Privacy and security are foundational to that mission.

        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <p>Information you provide directly (e.g., name, email, role like Veteran or Vendor, optional organization/state, and any message you share). We also receive limited technical data such as IP address and user-agent for security and abuse prevention.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="how-we-use">
        <h2>How we use your data</h2>
        <ul>

      </section>

      <section id="security">
        <h2>How we secure your data</h2>

      <section id="retention">
        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>We keep data only as long as needed for the purposes described above, then delete or de-identify it according to our retention rules and legal requirements.</p>
