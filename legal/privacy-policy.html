    <h1>Privacy Policy (Legal Version)</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 13, 2025</p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Veteran Verify</strong> (“<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information when you use our websites, forms, and services (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). By using the Services, you agree to this Policy.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2 id="scope">1) Scope &amp; Controller</h2>
    <p>
      This Policy applies to personal information we process through <strong>veteranverify.net</strong> and related domains, including any data submitted through our waitlist and verification forms. Veteran Verify is the data controller for this processing.
    </p>

    <h2 id="definitions">2) Key Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Information</strong> means information that identifies or can reasonably be linked to an individual.</li>
      <li><strong>Processing</strong> means any operation performed on personal information (e.g., collection, storage, use, disclosure).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="info-we-collect">3) Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><em>Information you provide</em> (examples):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name, email address, organization, state/region, messages/notes, role (e.g., veteran, vendor), and your preference to receive updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Automatically collected</em> (examples):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP address, device/browser user agent, general usage data (for security, anti-abuse, and reliability).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <em>Sensitive identifiers (e.g., SSN) and official records (e.g., DD-214)</em>: We do <strong>not</strong> request or store these through the current public forms. If our Services later introduce optional document upload or identity verification, we will present separate just-in-time notices and safeguards before any collection.
    </p>

    <h2 id="how-we-use">4) How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and improve the Services (including developing veteran verification workflows).</li>
      <li>To communicate with you, including service emails and (if opted in) product updates or pilot invitations.</li>
      <li>To maintain security, detect/prevent fraud/abuse, and ensure service reliability.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.</li>
      <li>To analyze aggregated, de-identified usage trends for product decisions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="legal-bases">5) Legal Bases for Processing (where applicable)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> (e.g., receiving updates/pilots).</li>
      <li><strong>Contract</strong> (e.g., delivering requested Services or early access).</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (e.g., security, improving Services).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligations</strong> (e.g., responding to lawful requests).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sharing">6) How We Share Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers</strong> under contract (e.g., hosting, database, analytics, email delivery) who must use data only on our instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal &amp; safety</strong>: to comply with law, enforce terms, or protect rights, safety, or security.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers</strong>: in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset sale; we will require the recipient to honor this Policy or provide notice and choices.</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="security">7) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information (e.g., encryption in transit and at rest where supported by our stack, access controls, audit logs, least-privilege practices, and environment-segregated keys). No security program is perfect; we continuously improve and monitor for threats.
    </p>

    <h2 id="retention">8) Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy, to provide the Services, and to meet legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain de-identified or aggregated data that does not identify you.
    </p>

    <h2 id="intl">9) International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      We may process and store data in the United States and other countries. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.
    </p>

    <h2 id="your-rights">10) Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Access, correction, deletion (subject to legal/operational limits).</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent to marketing at any time (unsubscribe links, or contact us).</li>
      <li>Object or restrict processing in certain circumstances.</li>
      <li>Data portability, where applicable.</li>

    </p>

    <h2 id="cookies">12) Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies</h2>
